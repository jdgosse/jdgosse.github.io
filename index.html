      <h2>Test Your Skill With a Proper Ranking System</h2>
      <p>For each smash game on Smash Ladder, there is a 6 tier ranking system in place. If you do well against people similar in rank or higher, your rank will increase. Conversely, your rank goes down more if you lose to someone with a lower rank. Ideally this provides a pretty accurate placing and a good way to challenge yourself by playing against people with a similar skill level. As you do better, you can potentially move up from Bronze rank all the way to Grand Smasher.</p>
